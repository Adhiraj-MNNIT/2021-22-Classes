## Tasks

### do...while loop

1. Write a program (WAP) that asks the user to enter an integer. If the number is even, the program should display the **square** of the number and continue asking the user to enter another number. If the number is odd, the program should display the **square root** of the number and continue asking the user to enter another number. The program should stop when the user enters 0 or negative number.

### break, continue, nested loops

1. Write a program that asks user for a number in a loop and then:
    - if the number is even (except 2), continues to the next iteration
    - else if number is non-prime, print that the number is odd and non-prime.
    - else if the number is prime, print that the number is prime and exit the loop.

2. WAP to display all palindromic numbers b/w 1 and 500.
3. WAP to print the binary representation of all number b/w 1 and 500.

### Print series

Write separate programs to print the following series:

1. 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., 100
2. 1, 4, 9, 16, ..., 100
3. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ..., 100 <- This is called the [Fibonacci series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

### Print patterns

Write separate programs using nested loops to print the following patterns:

1. 
    ```
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    ```

2. 
    ```
    1
    12
    123
    1234
    12345
    ```

3. 
    ```
        $
       $$
      $$$
     $$$$
    $$$$$
    ```

4. 
    ```
        *
       * *
      * * *
     * * * *
    * * * * *
    ```

5. 
    ```
    123454321
     1234321
      12321
       121
        1
    ```

6. 
    ```
        1
       212
      32123
     4321234
    543212345
    ```

7. 
    ```
    1       1
    12     21
    123   321
    1234 4321
    123454321
    ```
